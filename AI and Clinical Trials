Large language modelâ€“based solutions such as RECTIFIER can significantly enhance clinical trial screening performance and reduce costs by automating the screening process. 
However, integrating such technolo- gies requires careful consideration of potential hazards and should include safeguards such as final clinician review

Moreover, the cost of RECTIFIER was only 11 cents per patient. 
For comparison, the cost per screened patient for a phase 3 trial was reported to be approxi- mately $34.75 using traditional screening methods

Methods
3. RECTIFIER's RAG Implementation (Step-by-Step):
Data Load & Splitting:

RECTIFIER retrieves clinical notes for a patient.
These notes are divided into smaller chunks, ensuring each chunk is within GPT-4's context window while preserving contextual flow.

Vector Embeddings:
Each chunk of text is converted into a numerical representation called a vector embedding.
These vectors capture the meaning of the text in a way that allows for efficient similarity searches.
The 'ada-002' model from Azure OpenAI is used for this step.

Similarity Search (Retrieval):
The question being asked about the patient is also converted into a vector embedding.
The FAISS library is used to find the top 3 chunks of text that are most similar (semantically) to the question.

Prompting and Generation:
The retrieved chunks, along with the question and a system prompt, are fed into GPT-4.
GPT-4 processes this information and generates a "Yes" or "No" answer.



************************************************************************
From Gemini:
GPT-4, a powerful language model, in a system called RECTIFIER to automate the screening process for clinical trials

The Problem:
Screening patients for clinical trials is a time-consuming and error-prone process.
It requires manual chart review, which is expensive and can lead to delays in trial enrollment.

The Solution:
RECTIFIER: A system that uses GPT-4 and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to automatically extract information from electronic health records (EHRs).
RAG: RECTIFIER uses RAG to break down large clinical notes into smaller chunks, making them easier for GPT-4 to process.
GPT-4: The paper highlights GPT-4's ability to understand complex medical information and answer questions about patient eligibility criteria.
Key Findings:

High accuracy: RECTIFIER performed well, achieving an accuracy of 97.9% in determining patient eligibility for a heart failure trial.
Efficiency: The system was significantly faster than traditional methods and reduced costs by 11 cents per patient.
Cost-effectiveness: RECTIFIER was more cost-effective than using GPT-4 without the RAG architecture.

Potential Benefits:
Accelerated trial enrollment: Faster screening could lead to quicker patient recruitment and shorter trial durations.
Improved accuracy: Automation could minimize human error in the screening process.
Reduced costs: Automating screening could save money by reducing the need for manual review.

Important Considerations:
Potential hazards: The paper acknowledges the need for safeguards and emphasizes the importance of having a final clinician review of automated screening results.
Generalizability: The study was conducted on a heart failure trial, and further research is needed to determine if the results are generalizable to other clinical trials and conditions.
Overall:
This paper presents a promising approach to using AI to improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical trial screening. However, it's important to note the need for careful implementation and ongoing research to address potential hazards and ensure the technology's effectiveness across different clinical contexts.
